P2 Categories
=============

This is a fork of P2 version 1.5.1 with added category posting via a handy drop-down menu on the front page. 

This project has evolved from an article I've written which explained how to bring back posting into categories. The full process is explained here: http://wpguru.co.uk/2012/04/how-to-bring-back-post-categories-in-p2/

What served as a working example is now a fully working theme which is compatible with Automattic's wonderful P2 Theme.


Installation
============

This entire project is a WordPress theme. Download it and copy all files into a new folder under wp-content/themes. Then head over to Appearance - Themes and activate P2 Categories. It looks and works just like the original P2.

Or, an even easier way to install is by downloading this repo as a ZIP, then WordPress head over to Appearance - Themes - Install and upload it there.


How do P2 Categories work, and how do I use them?
=================================================

Simply write your post from the front page, then select a category from the drop down menu and hit post. 

The menu only shows existing categories. You cannot create categories from the front page. To do so, please use the admin interface and head over to Posts - Categories, then add a new category.
