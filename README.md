P2 Categories
=============

This is a Child Theme for Automattic's P2, with added support for posting into categories via a handy drop-down menu on the front page. 

This project has evolved from an article I've written which explained how to bring back posting into categories. The full process is explained here: http://wpguru.co.uk/2012/04/how-to-bring-back-post-categories-in-p2/

What served as a working example is now a fully working theme which is compatible with Automattic's wonderful P2 Theme.


Installation
============

This entire project is a WordPress Child Theme. Download and install the P2 Parent Theme first, then install and activate P2 Categories (install it like any other theme).

You can find P2 either by searching in the WordPress admin menu, or you can download it from here: http://wordpress.org/themes/p2


How do P2 Categories work, and how do I use them?
=================================================

Simply write your post from the front page, then select a category from the drop down menu and hit post. 

The menu only shows existing categories, even empty ones. You cannot create new categories from the front page though. To do so, please use the admin interface and head over to Posts - Categories, then add a new category.
